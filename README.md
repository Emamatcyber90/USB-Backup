USB-Backup
==========


[USB-Backup] is a free backup solution for creating encrypted backups to
external USB media.

For the compression and the backup format itself the proven and very stable
software [7-Zip] is used.


## Features

- local disks, such as the system disk C: can be backed up by using shadow
  copies (warning, this requires administrator privileges)
- the use of the program is user-friendly and has been developed in
  cooperation with users
- Network drives and UNC paths can also be backed up
- Installation: no setup, just one AutoIT script (put together into one
  executable)
- Security:
  - during the initial backup, a password is set - without a password, you can
    not back up!
  - when the external disk will be lost, a stranger can not really see what
    was backed up
  - only username@pc are stored plaintext, but this is used to distinguish the
    backups in case of emergency
  - an encrypted index is stored on the external disk, so that a restore at
    any time and on any computer is possible
- to each directory, you can create exception lists
- after a setable time, USB-Backup reminds the user to update the existing
  backup
- the degree of compression and other 7-Zip parameters can be completely
  adapted in the USB Backup.ini
- Automatic updates of program and help file are possible, but you can disable
  this also
- the help file is currently not finished, sorry about that :(
  - you can help me with that :)
